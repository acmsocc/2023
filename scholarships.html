            <p>The ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing 2023 (SoCC '23) is the fourteenth in an established series of symposia that bring together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing. SoCC offers multiple opportunities for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research works with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry.</p> 

            <p>To this end, the SoCC planning committee, is pleased to offer a small number of travel scholarships to help students defray the costs of attending the program. Priority will be given to students with an accepted paper at SoCC, as well as students from groups historically underrepresented at the conference. </p>

            <p>Applicants should be full time students (undergraduate or graduate) and will be expected to attend the full conference. Awardees will receive a partial reimbursement for conference registration and travel expenses.</p>
