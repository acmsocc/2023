            <p>Abstracts and poster drafts due: <b>Friday, September 25, 2023, 5:00 PM EDT</b></p>
            <p>Notification of acceptance: <b>Friday, October 2, 2023</b></p>

            <a id="overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
            <p>The SoCC poster sessions showcase works-in-progress in an informal setting. Topics of interest are the same as the research topics in the SoCC conference Call for papers. Presenting a poster is a great opportunity, especially for students, to obtain interesting and valuable feedback on ongoing research from a knowledgeable crowd at the conference. Moreover, accepted proposals will be published in the conference proceedings in citable form. </p>

            <a id="what_to_submit"><h2>What to submit?</h2></a>
            <p>For the poster submissions please submit a PDF document that includes (i) an abstract summarizing the work and (ii) a draft of the poster. The abstract should not be more than 1 page in length (excluding references). The abstract should clearly state: (a) the problem being addressed, (b) what makes this problem interesting, important, and difficult, (c) your approach to addressing the problem, and (d) the key contribution(s). In the final version of the abstract, we encourage (not require) you to include a URL providing additional information about your work to the attendees. The poster should be submitted as a PDF. We are requesting the poster drafts to ensure their quality and also to allow us to provide feedback to poster presenters.</p>

            <a id="submission_instructions"><h2>Submission Instructions</h2></a>
            <p>Submit your abstract and poster drafts in PDF format via the Posters submission website. Do not email submissions. Abstracts should not be anonymized: include all information (title, authors&#39; names and affiliations, text, and citations). Abstracts should use the following format and guidelines: Use US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a (7&#39;&#39; x 9&#39;&#39;) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by 0.33 in of whitespace. Use 10-point font on 12-point (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered and references within the paper should be hyperlinked. Submissions violating these guidelines will be rejected without review.</p>

            <p>Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">SIGPLAN Latex or MS Word templates from the ACM</a>, which we recommend using for submission. For Latex, we recommend you use:</p>

            <code>
            \documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}<br>
            \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}<br>
            \pagestyle{plain}<br>
            . . .<br>
            \settopmatter{printfolios=true}<br>
            \maketitle<br>
            </code>

            <p>Those whose submissions are accepted for a poster presentation will be asked to prepare a 3'x4' full-size color poster. SoCC’23 organizers will provide easels and boards for you to display your poster. The one-pager abstract will not be part of the SoCC’23 proceedings.</p>

            <p>Note that all authors of accepted papers are expected to present a poster as well. However, authors of accepted papers do not need to submit an abstract or the draft of their poster.</p>
