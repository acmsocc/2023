            <a id="overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
            <p>The SoCC poster sessions showcase works-in-progress in an informal setting. Topics of interest are the same as the research topics in the SoCC conference <a href="https://acmsocc.org/2023/papers.html" target=”_blank”>Call for papers</a>. Presenting a poster is a great opportunity, especially for students, to obtain interesting and valuable feedback on ongoing research from a knowledgeable crowd at the conference.  </p>

            <a id="what_to_submit"><h2>What to submit?</h2></a>
            <p>For the poster submissions please submit a PDF document with an abstract summarizing the work. The abstract should not be more than 1 page in length (excluding references). The abstract should clearly state: (a) the problem being addressed, (b) why is this an important problem and what are the challenges, (c) the solution approach, and (d) the results so far.
</p>

            <a id="submission_instructions"><h2>Submission Instructions</h2></a>
            <p>Submit your abstract in PDF format via the <a href="https://socc23poster.hotcrp.com/" target=”_blank”>poster submission website</a>. Do not email submissions. Abstracts should not be anonymized: include all information (title, authors' names and affiliations, text, and references). Abstracts must follow the ACM Proceedings Format, using either the sample-sigconf.tex provided at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target=”_blank”>https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a> for LaTeX (version 2e) or Word, respectively. We require 10pt font size for paper submission. The LaTeX template should be used as follows: \documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered and references within the paper should be hyperlinked. Submissions violating these guidelines will be rejected without review.</p>

            <p>Authors of accepted posters will be asked to prepare a 3'x4' full-size color poster. SoCC '23 organizers will provide easels and boards for you to display your poster. The one-pager abstract will not be part of the SoCC '23 proceedings.</p>

            <!-- <p>Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">SIGPLAN Latex or MS Word templates from the ACM</a>, which we recommend using for submission. For Latex, we recommend you use:</p> -->

            <!-- <code>
            \documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}<br>
            \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}<br>
            \pagestyle{plain}<br>
            . . .<br>
            \settopmatter{printfolios=true}<br>
            \maketitle<br>
            </code>

            <p>Those whose submissions are accepted for a poster presentation will be asked to prepare a 3'x4' full-size color poster. SoCC’23 organizers will provide easels and boards for you to display your poster. The one-pager abstract will not be part of the SoCC’23 proceedings.</p>

            <p>Note that all authors of accepted papers are expected to present a poster as well. However, authors of accepted papers do not need to submit an abstract or the draft of their poster.</p> -->
